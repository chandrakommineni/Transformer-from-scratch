# Project Name

This project encompasses various neural network architectures for natural language processing tasks.

## Section 1: RNN Implementation

Implemented a basic RNN cell, RNN Class, and an RNN Classifier.

## Section 2: Transformer Text Classifier

Implemented a Transformer-based Text classifier using components such as a Multi-head Attention Module, Positional Encoding Module, and Encoder.

## Section 3: Transformer Machine Translation

To experiment with Decoders for a Transformer, implemented a Transformer-based Machine Translation class using modules from Section 2, a Decoder, Attention Masks, and Seq-Seq Module.
