Section 1: Implmented a basic RNN cell, RNN Class and an RNN Classifier
Section 2: Implemented a Transformer based Text classifier using components such as Multi-head Attention Module, Positional Encoding Module and Encoder
Section 3: In order to experiment with Decoders for a Transformer, implemented a Transformer Based Machine Translation class using modules of Section 2, a Decoder, Attention Masks and Seq-Seq Module
